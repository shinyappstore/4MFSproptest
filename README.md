#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/4MFSproptest](https://shinyappstore.com/a/4MFSproptest)__

4MFSproptest, a vital tool in the MEPHAS suite, is designed for in-depth testing of binomial proportions. Binomial proportions refer to the probability of success or occurrence in a Bernoulli experiment. MEPHAS, an open-source and free web-interactive platform, supports statistical data analyses, particularly for researchers. 4MFSproptest provides an interface with distinct tabs for analyzing various scenarios, including One Single Proportion: Binomial Test, Two Independent Proportions: Chi-square Test, and Chi-square Trend Test. Users can leverage 4MFSproptest to determine the statistical significance of population rates or proportions in their data, assess the compatibility between sample and population rates, understand the probability of success in a Bernoulli experiment, among other functionalities. This application serves as a comprehensive tool for researchers engaged in binomial proportion analysis. Original publication: BMC Bioinformatics. 2020 May 11;21(1):183.
